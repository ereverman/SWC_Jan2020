## Opening introduction:
  1. Postdoctoral Fellow in Macdonald Lab here at KU. I study quantitative and evolutionary genetics and genomics.
  2. The first coding language I learned is R, and this is where I am most comfortable. I have found other coding languages easier to learn having some basis to start from.


## Quick Survey:
Let's get a quick quage of experience level with R

*** Post in Etherpad:

```
In the last 6 months:
A. I have installed R and R Studio on my computer but haven't used it.
B. I have used R a few times.
C. I have used R frequently.

```


## Start the Lesson:

(here is the link to the repo: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)

* Earlier today, you cloned the Git repository with the data you will need for today and tomorrow's R lesson. There should be a directory on your desktop named: ku-swc-files-master. We won't work with this yet, but will need it a little later.

* We asked you to download both R and R Studio. Please put up your help sticky if you haven't downloaded both of these programs. 
  * The reason that we use both R and R Studio:
    * R is a programming language and a software tool for data manipulation, statistics, and data visualization. When you downloaded R, you downloaded the base version of this tool. You don't need R Studio to use R. 
    * R Studio is an IDE for R. IDE is integrated development environment. R Studio has several additional tools that help you organize your data projects and keep track of the scripts you write to run specific analyses.
